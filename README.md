# Article Clone
This page is a clone of [an article page from NewScientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2286218-ancient-lake-in-marss-gale-crater-may-have-actually-been-a-small-pond/). It was created by **Angel Cornejo** as part of *[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)*. 

The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to accurately recreate a professional design using only the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

It is intentionally not pixel perfect (I did not use any imported fonts, primarily) to make it immediately obvious that:
1. It is the same design, precisely re-created
2. It is not a simple copy and paste of the source.

Hover effects were implemented but since there is no javascript no links or buttons have any functionality.
